# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. We are using different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes as we've been asked to use the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.  We are evaluating the performance of these models to write a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
